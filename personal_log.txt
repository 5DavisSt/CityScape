Using version ^1.20 for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle
PS C:\Users\steve\cityscape> symfony console make:reset-password

Let's make a password reset feature!
====================================

 Implementing reset password for App\Entity\User

- ResetPasswordController -
---------------------------

 A named route is used for redirecting after a successful reset. Even a route that does not exist yet can be used here.

 What route should users be redirected to after their password has been successfully reset? [app_home]:
 > app_login

- Email -
---------

 These are used to generate the email code. Don't worry, you can change them in the code later!

 What email address will be used to send reset confirmations? e.g. mailer@your-domain.com:
 > wontgoquietly@example.com

 What "name" should be associated with that email address? e.g. "Acme Mail Bot":
 > Example Inc.

  Success!


 Next:
   1) Run "symfony.exe console make:migration" to generate a migration for the new "App\Entity\ResetPasswordRequest" entity.
   2) Review forms in "src/Form" to customize validation and labels.
   3) Review and customize the templates in `templates/reset_password`.
   4) Make sure your MAILER_DSN env var has the correct settings.
   5) Create a "forgot your password link" to the app_forgot_password_request route on your login form.

 Then open your browser, go to "/reset-password" and enjoy!
